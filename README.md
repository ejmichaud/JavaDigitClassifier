# JavaDigitClassifier
A simple program that tries to classify the numerals that users draw. 

If you have the Java SDK installed, simply run
'''
java GUI
'''
And the program will launch. Drag your cursor along the grid to draw a single digit (0-9) and click _input digit to network_. 

The entire program and its dependencies were written in Java, from the ground up. Special thanks to my friend
William Daeseking for designing the GUI. I couldn't have done it without him.
